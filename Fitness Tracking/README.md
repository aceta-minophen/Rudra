# Rudra - Fitness Tracking 🏋️‍♀️

## 👩‍💻 Technologies Required
1. Camera - action recognition (when drinking/eating/fall detection)
2. Phone app - setting reminders, configuring health settings and food/water timings, sending alerts, meal planning
3. Database/datasets - action recognition, calories associated with different foods, water timings for different age groups
4. Smart voice assistant features - ask questions about what is being eaten, or what action is being performed to continuously keep training Rudra

## 🎋 Solution Integration
1. Setting up reminders for medicines and water in the app 
2. Setting up age and health specifications to allow algorithm to calculate how much water is required and at what intervals.
    1. Recording the amount of water being drunk (computer vision - noticing when human is drinking water and logging it in: **action detection**)
    2. Logging in what food is being consumed and track calories (Ex: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.bite.biteapp&hl=en&gl=US) 
    3. Plan next meal accordingly 
3. Fall detection using computer vision to send alert if fatal fall is detected
