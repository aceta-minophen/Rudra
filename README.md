## ü™∂ Features
### 1. Voice Assistant 
> Often, the elderly are socially isolated, and many exist within the confines of a nursing home or an institution, where their main social links are only with other inmates and equally alienated old people. <sup>[[1]](https://github.com/aceta-minophen/Rudra/edit/main/README.md#-references)</sup>

Rudra's main goal is to interact with the elderly and keep them engaged. This will vastly help uplift their mental health, allow them to keep up with the times while also having someone to reminisce about the olden days with. Besides that, the family members won't feel burdened with their already busy lives, and can rest knowing the elderly are being well taken care of.

#### 1.1. Implementation

Rudra is a fully voice-operated, completely hands-free system for the elderly, so all they have to do is talk to Rudra to get a job done.

The voice assistant has been specially curated according to the needs of the elderly. It performs timely check ups on them, allows them to create reminders for themselves, listen to stories, call up any family members, and have a sympathic discussion on any topic they desire with the robot.

All this is accomplished by employing the following:
1. **NLP**: Natural language processing helps in discerning the tone and context of any spoken sentence, allowing Rudra to have more sympathetic reactions to it. **DialogFlow** has been used for this purpose.
2. **Expression-wise response**: Rudra continuously monitors the elderly's expressions to further improve the user's experience. This also helps in monitoring their mental health regularly.
3. **Query response**: Several API's have been used for providing the best one-shop-stop solution for any miscellanious queries the user might have. The API's are:
    1. Dialogflow
    2. Firebase Realtime Database
    3. Google Calendar
    4. [News](https://newsapi.org/)
    5. [Weather](https://openweathermap.org/api)
4. **Meal suggestion and reminders**: Physical wellbeing is equally as important as mental health, therefore, Rudra is designed to timely remind the elderly to drink water, have food and take any medicines if needed.
5. **Action Recognition**: Computer vision is used to make sure that the elderly has drunk water, had food and slept properly. The data is only updated in the backend once Rudra detects the above stated actions and then confirms them with the user to avoid misinterpretation.

#### 1.2. Working
- The code for the voice assistant is hosted on the Raspberry Pi.
- The voice input and output is taken and given through bluetooth headset connected to the Raspberry Pi. This helps eliminate any background noise. If multiple people are talking at once, Rudra will only hear the designated elderly speak.
- Every time that the elderly wants to initiate a conversation, they can do so by simply using the wakeword: "Hey, Rudra".
- The voice output can also be given using speakers connect to the Raspberry Pi, if the user wishes it so.

#### 1.3. Backend
Since Rudra works with a lot of different modules where data needs to be collected from different sensors and devices, **Firebase Realtime Database** is used to integrate all these separate nodes. Any data of food, water or medicine intake is committed to the database, along with important information regarding the elserly's current mood and other statements for future reference to further optimize the assistant's replies.

### 2. Human Following
In order to be able to monitor the elderly at all times, Rudra follows them around the house. It can be ordered when to start and stop following using voice commands as per the user's wishes. A key advantage of this feature is that it will always keep the elderly in view and will be able to send out notifications on the app for the family members in case any emergency arises. This also allows Rudra to be always present with the elderly if they want something or simply need to have a chat.

The following is accomplished by using **computer vision**. The algorithm works such that when the user's face is spotted, Rudra can move forward or backward based on the distance, and it can move left or right based on the position of the face with respect to the centre.

In case of an emergency, by using **SVM algorithm**, Rudra can send the location of the exact room they are in for immediate action. Here, the algorithm is trained with Wi-Fi RSSI values measured beforehand for each room. Each class is labelled with the room name, and Rudra can then figure out which room it is currently in by comparing the present RSSI values with the recorded ones.

### 3. Remote Control and Monitoring
Using **Rudra's Companion App**, family members or other caretakers can continue to remotely monitor the elderly using the following aspects of the app:
- **Water log, food log, sleep log**: The home page of Rudra gives all this information, along with suggesting the next meals based on the user's preference and required calorie intake.
- **Remote control and live video feed**: The users with access can remotely control the robot if they need to, and simultaneously they can check out the live feed from Rudra's camera. Using this, they can also recieve calls from the elderly on the app itself and talk to them via the robot. 
- **Reminders and calendar**: Users can view the elderly's reminders and cross off any checklist items the elderly requires like groceries or medicines.
